This guide walks through setting up each component of the AI Conversation Bridge.

> **Important:** All components must be deployed to **public-facing cloud environments** so they can communicate with each other and receive webhooks from external platforms. This guide uses Google Cloud Run as the example, but any container platform with a public HTTPS endpoint works (AWS App Runner, Azure Container Apps, Alibaba Cloud Elastic Container Instance, Tencent Kubernetes Engine, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- A container hosting platform with public URLs (e.g., [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run))
- A Flowise instance ([cloud](https://flowiseai.com/) or [self-hosted](#self-hosting-flowise) on public-facing infrastructure)
- LINE WORKS Developer Console access and/or DingTalk Developer Console access (for bot credentials)

## 1. Demo MCP Server

The demo MCP server provides mock Workday tools for development and testing. Like the chat connector, it should be **deployed to a cloud environment** (e.g., Google Cloud Run) so that your Flowise instance can reach it. If you use a different provider (AWS App Runner, Azure Container Apps, Alibaba Cloud Elastic Container Instance, Tencent Kubernetes Engine, etc.), adapt the deployment commands accordingly.

> **Production note:** The demo MCP server is for development only and has no authentication. In production, configure your Flowise flow's MCP client node to point to **Workday's official MCP endpoints** via Agent Gateway, which provides OAuth 2.1, mTLS, and other enterprise security controls. See the [Production Security](../mcp-demo-server/README.md#production-security) section for details.

### Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud run deploy mcp-demo-server \
  --source mcp-demo-server
```

After deployment, Cloud Run provides a public URL (e.g., `https://mcp-demo-server-abc123.us-west1.run.app`). Use this URL when configuring the Flowise MCP client node.

### Verify

The MCP server exposes tools via streamable HTTP transport at the `/mcp` path. You can connect to it from any MCP client (Flowise, Claude Desktop, etc.) at your deployed URL (e.g., `https://mcp-demo-server-abc123.us-west1.run.app/mcp`).

## 2. Flowise Flow

### Import the Flow

1. Open your Flowise instance
2. Navigate to **Agent Flows** → **Add New**
3. Click **Settings** (⚙️) → **Load Agentflow**
4. Select `flowise/flows/workday-mcp-agent.json`

### Configure the Agent Node

After importing, click the **AI Bridge Agent** node and configure:

1. **Model** — The flow defaults to OpenRouter with the free `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` model (Z.ai GLM, a China-based LLM). Add an OpenRouter credential in Flowise, or switch to any other provider with your own API key. Good choices for APJ include Z.ai GLM, Qwen/Alibaba (Tongyi Qianwen), and DeepSeek for China-hosted deployments, or OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini elsewhere.
2. **Custom MCP Tool** — Update the MCP server URL in the tool configuration:
   - **Demo:** Your deployed demo MCP server URL + `/mcp` (e.g., `https://mcp-demo-server-abc123.us-west1.run.app/mcp`). For the demo server, you can omit the `Authorization` header.
   - **Production:** Your Workday Agent Gateway URL (replace the demo server with Workday's official MCP endpoints, which require proper authentication)

### Get the Prediction URL

1. Click the flow's **API Endpoint** button
2. Copy the prediction URL (e.g., `https://your-flowise.com/api/v1/prediction/<flow-id>`)
3. You'll need this for the chat connector configuration

## 3. Chat Connector

The chat connector receives webhooks from messaging platforms, so it **must be deployed to a public-facing environment** with an HTTPS URL. This guide uses Google Cloud Run as the example. If you use a different provider (AWS App Runner, Azure Container Apps, Alibaba Cloud Elastic Container Instance, Tencent Kubernetes Engine, etc.), adapt the deployment commands accordingly.

### Configuration

Prepare your environment variables. You can use `chat-connector/.env.example` as a reference:

```bash
# Point to your Flowise flow
AI_PROVIDER=flowise
FLOWISE_API_URL=https://your-flowise.com/api/v1/prediction/<flow-id>
FLOWISE_API_KEY=your-flowise-api-key

# LINE WORKS bot credentials
LW_API_20_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
LW_API_20_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
LW_API_20_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=your-service-account-id
LW_API_20_PRIVATEKEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
LW_API_20_BOT_ID=your-bot-id
LW_API_20_BOT_SECRET=your-bot-secret

# DingTalk HTTP robot settings
# Use admin-console employee UserID values. The connector requires DingTalk's senderStaffId field.
DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS=ding-user-id-1,ding-user-id-2
DINGTALK_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=false
DINGTALK_REQUIRE_MENTION=true
DINGTALK_GROUP_SESSIONS_PER_USER=true
```

> **Security:** `LW_API_20_BOT_SECRET` enables webhook signature verification — the connector rejects any callback whose `X-WORKS-Signature` header doesn't match. You can find your Bot Secret in the LINE WORKS Developer Console under your bot's details. If omitted, signature verification is skipped with a warning (acceptable for local development, **not for production**).
>
> **Note on private keys:** When setting `LW_API_20_PRIVATEKEY` in your container platform, newline handling varies. You can paste the key directly (the connector normalizes the format automatically), use literal `\n` characters, or store the key in a secrets manager (recommended). See [Private Key Formatting](#private-key-formatting) below.
>
> **Compatibility:** `CHAT_PROVIDER` is still accepted as a fallback for existing deployments, but new configuration should use `AI_PROVIDER`.

### Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud run deploy chat-connector \
  --source chat-connector
```

> **Important:** Don't forget to set your environment variables in the Cloud Run console after deploying! You will need to configure your AI provider (like `AI_PROVIDER` and `FLOWISE_API_URL`) as well as any channel connector credentials. See `chat-connector/.env.example` for the full list of variables.

After deployment, Cloud Run provides a public URL (e.g., `https://chat-connector-abc123.us-west1.run.app`). You'll use this as your webhook URL.

For sensitive values like `LW_API_20_PRIVATEKEY`, consider using [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/secrets) instead of plain environment variables:

```bash
gcloud run deploy chat-connector \
  --source chat-connector \
  --set-env-vars "AI_PROVIDER=flowise,FLOWISE_API_URL=..." \
  --set-secrets "LW_API_20_PRIVATEKEY=lw-private-key:latest"
```

### LINE WORKS Bot Setup

1. Go to the [LINE WORKS Developer Console](https://developers.worksmobile.com/)
2. Create a Bot
3. Set the callback URL to your deployed chat connector's public URL + `/lineworks/callback` (e.g., `https://chat-connector-abc123.us-west1.run.app/lineworks/callback`)
4. Set the environment variables on your container platform with the bot credentials

`/callback` is still supported as a backwards-compatible LINE WORKS alias, but new deployments should use `/lineworks/callback`.

### DingTalk HTTP Robot Setup

1. Go to the [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/) and create an enterprise internal app.
2. Add the Robot capability to the app.
3. Configure robot message receiving in HTTP mode.
4. Set the callback URL to your deployed chat connector's public URL + `/dingtalk/callback` (e.g., `https://chat-connector-abc123.us-west1.run.app/dingtalk/callback`).
5. Create and publish an app version that includes the Robot capability. The app version and the robot capability must both be published before DingTalk includes `senderStaffId` in callbacks.
6. Add the published robot to an internal group in the same DingTalk organization from the DingTalk chat group settings: open the group, open group settings, go to **Group Management** → **Robots**, then add the published enterprise robot.
7. Set `DINGTALK_ALLOWED_USERS` to the DingTalk employee UserID values that may use the bot, or set `DINGTALK_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` only for controlled demos.

By default, DingTalk direct messages receive a response from allowed users. Group messages require an @mention (`DINGTALK_REQUIRE_MENTION=true`), and group chat sessions are isolated per user (`DINGTALK_GROUP_SESSIONS_PER_USER=true`).

The connector authorizes DingTalk users with `senderStaffId`, which corresponds to the employee UserID available in the DingTalk admin console. It intentionally ignores callbacks that only include encrypted `senderId` values, because those are not practical for admins to retrieve or manage. If logs show `Ignoring DingTalk message without senderStaffId`, confirm the DingTalk app version and robot capability are both published, and that the published robot is installed in an internal group for the same organization.

### Feishu (Lark) Bot Setup

1. Go to the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/app) and create an enterprise app.
2. Enable **Event Subscription** and subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1`.
3. Set the request URL to your deployed chat connector's public URL + `/feishu/callback` (e.g., `https://chat-connector-abc123.us-west1.run.app/feishu/callback`).
4. Copy the **Verification Token** into `FEISHU_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`, and set `FEISHU_APP_ID` / `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` from the app credentials page.
5. Leave **Encrypt Key** disabled unless you add payload decryption support — encrypted callbacks return HTTP 400 with a clear error.

### Quick Test with OpenRouter

If you want to test the chat connector without Flowise:

```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free
```

This connects configured chat channels directly to an LLM via OpenRouter — useful for verifying webhook flows before adding Flowise orchestration.

### Private Key Formatting

Container platforms handle multi-line environment variables differently. The chat connector automatically normalizes the PEM private key, so all of these approaches work:

- **Paste directly** in the Cloud Run console or equivalent — newlines may become spaces, but the connector handles this
- **Use literal `\n`** when setting via CLI — e.g., `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQI...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
- **Use a secrets manager** (recommended) — stores the key with exact formatting preserved

### Scaling

The chat connector runs Gunicorn with a single worker process, meaning each container instance handles one request at a time. To support concurrent users, configure your Cloud Run (or equivalent container platform) auto-scaling settings to add instances as traffic increases. Key settings to consider:

- **Max instances** — controls cost by capping how many containers can run simultaneously
- **Concurrency** — set to 1 for the simplest model (one request per instance), or increase if you add Gunicorn threads
- **Min instances** — set to 1 or more to avoid cold starts for latency-sensitive environments

## Self-Hosting Flowise

If you prefer to host your own Flowise instance instead of using [Flowise Cloud](https://flowiseai.com/), it must be deployed to **public-facing infrastructure** so that the chat connector can reach its prediction API. Deploy Flowise to Cloud Run, Alibaba Cloud Elastic Container Instance, Tencent Kubernetes Engine, a VM with a public IP, or any platform that provides an HTTPS endpoint. See the [Flowise self-hosting documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/configuration/deployment) for deployment options.
